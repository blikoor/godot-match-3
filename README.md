## Mission
Our mission is to bring game creators together and to become better game developers.

### Goals
- Learn game development with Godot, GDScript, C#
- Help and learn form other game creators
- Develop fun and polished games and demos

Do you want to contribute and help improve your own and our game development skills with Godot? Check out the open issues, suggest improvements and report bugs by opening new ones. ðŸ˜Ž

### Project Scope
We are building a vertical slice demo that the community can learn from. More details will follow later.

### Support Us
We need your support to improve our programming skills, if your a experience programmer or game developer, consider contributing to the project.

### Contributing Guidelines
All contributors are welcome. ðŸ™‚
- Get in touch and communicate! Let us know what you are working on or report bugs using the issues tab. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3MFE6UN) to discuss the project live or to get in touch with the community
- Be respectful to everyone around. Please check out the this Code of Conduct from [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/).
- For code, we follow the [GDScript styleguide](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html). We try to write clean and self-documenting GDScript as it helps us build upon each other's work. We use static typing to write more robust code and get full autocompletion in Godot.
- The maintainers may refactor or tweak your code to make it fit the project's style, and for educational purposes. But we'll give you the opportunity to refine the style by yourself ðŸ˜„
